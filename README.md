# Beijing Air Quality Analysis Using Power BI

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Beijing Air Quality Analysis** project! This repository contains an in-depth analysis of the air quality in Beijing using Power BI and Excel. The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize the air pollution levels in Beijing, identify trends, and derive insights that can be used for making data-driven decisions to improve air quality.

## Key Features
ðŸ“Œ Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis: Monitor and evaluate the air quality index over time, identifying patterns and trends.

ðŸ“Œ Pollutant Concentration Tracking: Measure and analyze the levels of key pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3.

ðŸ“Œ Seasonal and Temporal Insights: Discover how air quality varies with seasons, weather conditions, and time of day.

ðŸ“Œ Geographical Mapping: Visualize air quality data across different regions of Beijing, pinpointing areas with critical pollution levels.

## Built with
- Power BI Desktop
- Excel

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is obtained from [source link] and includes information on various air pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3 from multiple monitoring stations across Beijing over several years.

Key features of the dataset:
- Date and time of the measurements
- Concentrations of pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3)
- Meteorological data (temperature, pressure, dew point, wind speed, etc.)

## Key Insights
- Air Quality Trends: Observe how air quality has changed over months and years, identifying periods of significant improvement or decline.
- Pollutant Sources: Determine the primary sources of various pollutants, aiding in targeted mitigation strategies.
- Impact of Policies: Assess the effectiveness of environmental policies and regulations on improving air quality.
- Health Implications: Understand the potential health risks associated with varying levels of air pollution.

## Analysis

The analysis focuses on the following key areas:
- **Trend Analysis:** Identifying trends in air pollution over time.
- **Seasonal Variations:** Understanding how air quality varies with seasons.


## Visualizations

Various visualizations have been created to represent the data effectively, including:
- Line charts for trend analysis.
- Bar charts for comparing pollution levels.
- Donut chart for understanding distribution.

## Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides an interactive way to explore the air quality data. It includes multiple pages with detailed visualizations and filters to allow users to dive deep into specific aspects of the data.


## Technologies Used

- **Power BI:** For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- **Microsoft Excel:** For data cleaning and preliminary analysis.
- **Python:** For data preprocessing and advanced analysis (optional).
